## Introduction

This is a Webpack loader used in stripes-core to pull in components from
modules. The configuration you set there to enable modules is actually
consumed by this package, as is the module configuration and metadata.

It runs in Node.js via Webpack when Stripes is being bundled for a tenant
and not in any browser.
